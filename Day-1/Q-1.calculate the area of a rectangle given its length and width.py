# Write a Python program to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width

# Input the length and width of the rectangle from the user
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Display the result
print(f"The area of the rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}")
