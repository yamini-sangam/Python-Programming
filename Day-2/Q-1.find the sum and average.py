# Given a list of numbers, find the sum and average

# Sample list of numbers
numbers = [12, 45, 7, 23, 56, 9, 1, 78, 34]

# Calculate the sum of numbers
sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers)

# Calculate the average of numbers
average = sum_of_numbers / len(numbers)

# Display the results
print(f"Sum of the numbers: {sum_of_numbers}")
print(f"Average of the numbers: {average:.2f}")
